# node-red-contrib-tcp-client

Unlike the default node-red tcp-in node, this one allows to create a dynamic TCP client.

It also allows XML output.

## How it works:

![node configuration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tiagordc/node-red-contrib-simple-soap/master/edit.png)

### Future:

Reset connection

## To install: 

Install node-red.

Install this package with "npm install node-red-contrib-tcp-client --save" in ~./node-red or via the Palette Manager in node-red.

If everything was successfull you should see the new tcp node under the network category.
